You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

---

	* I’ve learned the data-tree viewing and this way to see the projects and the tags
	inside the HTML, I’ve been prepared for this course since a couple of months to
	do my best and try to get a job after finish it and maybe start the react 		nano-degree.

	* Nothing is easy, I have to keep my eye to detail always and trying to do my 		best,and, probably, still making some noob errors. This is why I’m coursing the 	nano-degree program :)

	* Now, in this lessons, I didn’t find something difficult, a real challenge, 		because the real challenge is improve every-day and be in constant learning 
	and motivated.

	* I tried to think as a proper developer to solve the problems, analyzing and
	looking for the success, an the real learning. I used the MDN specifically for 		this project.
